title: "IP Whitelisting"
description: "Secure your Monxa API access by restricting traffic to trusted IP addresses and ranges only."
---

The **IP whitelisting** feature secures your Monxa API traffic by permitting only specific IP addresses or ranges to access your APIs. Any request from a non-allowlisted IP will be automatically rejected, helping protect your integration from foreign or malicious traffic.

<Danger>
  - IP Allowlist only applies to **direct API integrations** and does not work with plugins (e.g., Shopify, WooCommerce).
  - Only **Admin users** can manage IP Allowlist settings in the Dashboard.
</Danger>

### Key Features

- **IPv4 and CIDR support**: Add single IPs (e.g., `192.168.1.10`) or entire ranges in CIDR format (e.g., `192.0.2.0/24`).
- **Flexible management**: Add or remove IPs anytime via the Dashboard.
- **Strict validation**: If no IPs are added, Monxa will not enforce validation. Once IPs are listed, only those are allowed.

### Managing IP Addresses

**Add IPs**

1. Go to **Dashboard \> IP Allowlist**.
2. Click **Add IP Address**.
3. Enter one or multiple IPs (one per line).
4. Save to activate restrictions.

**Delete IPs**

1. Select the IP(s) you want to remove.
2. Click **Delete** in the top-right corner.

### Testing Your IP Allowlist

To confirm your setup:

1. Find your device or server IP (check [your IP here](#)).
2. Use Postman or your API client to send requests to Monxa’s API.
   - If the request originates from an **allowlisted IP**, it will succeed.
   - If it originates from a **non-allowlisted IP**, it will be rejected.

**Example**

- Allowlisted IP: `yy.yy.yyy.yyy`.
- Test request from a different IP → API will reject the request.

<Tip>
  IP Allowlist adds a strong layer of defense by restricting API access to trusted servers only, protecting your business from unauthorized traffic.
