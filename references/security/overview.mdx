## Account Security

At **Monxa**, protecting your business and payment data is our top priority. We implement enterprise-grade safeguards, including **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**, **granular user permissions**, and **secure API key management** to ensure your account remains safe.

## Why Security Matters

- **Prevent unauthorized access** – Block malicious actors from accessing your data or initiating fraudulent payments.
- **Maintain customer trust** – Customers expect their payment information to be protected at all times.
