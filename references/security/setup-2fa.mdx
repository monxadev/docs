## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

**Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** adds an extra layer of protection to your Monxa account, making it significantly more difficult for unauthorized users to gain access. We strongly recommend that all users enable 2FA.

## Why Enable 2FA?

2FA protects your account by requiring **two forms of authentication**:

- **Something you know** – your Monxa account password.
- **Something you have** – a time-sensitive code generated by an authenticator app on your mobile device.

This prevents unauthorized access even if your password is compromised.

## Supported 2FA Methods

Monxa supports 2FA using **Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP)** apps, including:

- Google Authenticator
- Authy
- Microsoft Authenticator

<Danger>
  **Note:** SMS-based 2FA is not supported for security reasons.
</Danger>

## How to Set Up 2FA

1. **Log in** to your Monxa account.
2. Go to **Settings \> Profile \> Security \> Two-Factor Authentication**.
3. Click **Enable 2FA**.
4. **Scan the QR code** using your preferred authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator).
5. Enter the **6-digit code** generated by the app.
6. **Save your recovery codes** in a secure offline location. These are required if you lose access to your device.

<Tip>
  - **Keep recovery codes safe:** Store them securely offline, separate from your phone.
  - **Multiple devices:** You can set up 2FA on more than one device for backup.
  - **Disabling 2FA:** You may disable it in your Security Settings, but this is strongly discouraged.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

- **Invalid codes?** Ensure your mobile device time is synced correctly. TOTP codes are time-based.
- **Lost your device?** Use your recovery codes to log in and reconfigure 2FA on a new device.
- **Need help?** Contact **Monxa Support** for assistance with setup or recovery.
