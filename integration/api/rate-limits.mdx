Monxa applies **API rate limits** to maintain platform stability and ensure fair usage across all clients. These limits help prevent overloads while allowing legitimate traffic to flow smoothly.

## How rate limits work

Monxa uses **adaptive rate limiting**, which means you’ll generally only encounter limits if:

- The platform is under **exceptional load**.
- Your account exceeds configured thresholds.
- We detect potential **system abuse**.

<Note>
  Rate limits apply to your **entire account** (all API keys, users, and sub-entities). They are not applied per credential.
</Note>

## Default concurrency limits

By default, the maximum **requests per second (RPS)** across all Monxa APIs are:

- **Read operations** → 100 RPS
- **Write operations** → 100 RPS

Sandbox environments have **lower limits**, since they are designed for testing and not production load. Your limits may differ if:

- You’ve arranged custom limits with Monxa support.
- Temporary restrictions are applied due to detected misuse.

## Handling rate limits

If you receive a **429 Too Many Requests** response, you’ve hit a rate limit.

To handle this gracefully:

1. **Retry with backoff** – Implement exponential backoff with jitter to retry at increasing intervals.
2. **Client-side traffic management** – Use algorithms like **token bucket** or **leaky bucket** to control how many requests your system sends at once.
3. **Monitor frequency** – If 429 responses are frequent, contact Monxa support to discuss your throughput requirements.

## Load testing

Load testing against Monxa APIs will likely trigger rate limiting. To avoid issues:

- Coordinate with Monxa before conducting large-scale or stress testing.
- We may be able to:
  - Provide **temporary higher limits**.
  - Arrange **dedicated testing windows**.
  - Set up **special sandbox environments** for performance testing.

<Warning>
  **Important**: Do not use the standard sandbox for load testing—its reduced limits are not designed for stress scenarios.
</Warning>

<Check>
  With Monxa’s rate limits, your integrations remain **stable, predictable, and fair across all users**.
