Monxa provides a simple and reliable way for merchants to issue refunds directly through our platform. Whether you need to process a **full refund** or a **partial refund**, our system is designed to be flexible, transparent, and easy to manage.

## Why Refunds with Monxa?

1. **Instant Digital Wallet Refunds**\
   Monxa is directly integrated with leading e-wallets, enabling refunds to be credited back to the customerâ€™s balance almost instantly. This ensures a smooth and fast refund experience, with funds returned using the same payment method.
2. **Streamlined Management**\
   Refunds can be created and tracked via the Monxa Dashboard or API. No manual intervention is required, allowing you to resolve refund requests quickly and consistently.
3. **Flexible Refund Options**\
   Merchants can issue full or partial refunds, making it easy to handle scenarios like partial returns, cancellations, or service adjustments.
4. **Detailed Tracking & Transparency**\
   Every refund is logged with full tracking details, so you can monitor status in real time and keep your customers informed. This also ensures accurate records for reporting and compliance.

## Refund Limitations

Currently, Monxa supports refunds for the following payment methods:

- **Wallets**
- **QRIS**

## Refund Eligibility

To qualify for a refund:

1. The original payment must be made via **Wallet** or **QRIS**.
2. Refund requests must be submitted within the allowed refund period.
3. The refund amount cannot exceed the original payment.
4. For settled payments, refunds will be deducted from your next available settlement balance for the same payment method. Refunds can only proceed if sufficient balance is available.
5. QRIS refunds may be subject to restrictions depending on the issuing bank of the payer.
6. Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) fees applied during settlement are **non-refundable**. Refunds on settled transactions will be adjusted against the settlement amount.

## Integration Guide

### Step 1: Create a Refund

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Endpoint" iconType="solid">
    Use the following endpoint to retrieve the latest status of a payment:

    | Method | Endpoint                          |
    | :----- | :-------------------------------- |
    | POST   | `https://api.monxa.co/v1/refunds` |
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Request Example">
    The following are the sample request body for creating a refund:

    ```
    curl -X POST \
      https://api.monxa.co/v1/refunds \
      -H 'authorization: [Base64({Your_Server_Key}:)]' \
      -H 'content-type: application/json' \
      -d '{
        "ref_id": "abc",
        "payment_id": "pay_IsL5nOCW4M2790",
        "amount": "10000",
        "use_refund_link": "true"
        "notes": "rejected product"
    }'
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Handle Refund Response

Refund processing is synchronous. The `status` field in the API response indicates the outcome of the request.

**Response Example**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "rfn_abc123",
    "ref_id": "order_ref_123",
    "amount": "10000",
    "refund_type": "partial",
    "status": "done",
    "created_at": "2025-09-12T10:43:42Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-09-12T10:44:01Z",
    "approved_at": "2025-09-12T10:44:01Z",
    "source": "api",
    "customer_name": "John Doe",
    "customer_email": "john@example.com",
    "customer_phone": "+628123456789"
  }
}
```

If the status is `done`, the refund has been successfully processed and the customer should see the funds reflected in their account.
