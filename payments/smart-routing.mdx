Smart Routing is Monxa’s **intelligent payment recovery mechanism** that ensures your transactions achieve the **highest possible success rate**.

When the primary processor encounters downtime, technical issues, or increased decline rates, Monxa automatically reroutes the payment to a backup processor in real time—keeping your business uninterrupted.

## How It Works

- **Automatic Fallbacks** – If a payment attempt fails with the first processor, Monxa instantly retries with another available processor.
- **Performance-Based Selection** – The system continuously monitors processor performance. When performance drops, new transactions are redirected to the best-performing provider.
- **Transaction Integrity** – Smart Routing only applies to **new transactions**. Any transaction already created will continue with the originally assigned processor.

## Setup ⚙️

Smart Routing is **automatically enabled** for:

- **Dynamic QRIS**
- **Dynamic Closed Virtual Accounts**

This ensures your payments are always routed for **maximum success**, without any manual configuration.

## Benefits 🚀

- **Improved Reliability** – Payments are routed to the most stable processor, reducing declines.
- **Increased Revenue** – More successful transactions translate to higher captured sales.
- **Operational Efficiency** – Eliminates manual troubleshooting by intelligently selecting the best provider.
