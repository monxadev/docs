The **Payment Cancellation API** allows merchants to **cancel payments that are still in the “processing” stage**, giving you full control to stop transactions before they reach a final status.

This is particularly useful for scenarios such as:

- Managing inventory when an item is out of stock.
- Enforcing time-sensitive payment rules.
- Applying custom business logic to align with operational policies or customer requests.

By providing this capability, the API helps merchants **maintain transaction control, streamline operations, and improve the customer experience**.

## How to Cancel a Payment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Step 1. Call the Cancel Payment API" defaultOpen iconType="solid">
    Use the following endpoint to cancel a payment:

    | Method | Endpoint                                        |
    | :----- | :---------------------------------------------- |
    | GET    | `https://api.monxa.dev/v1/payments/{id}/cancel` |

    Replace `{id}` with the `payment_id` of the transaction you want to cancel.

    <Tip>
      Note: You can only cancel a payment if its status is still  `processing` 
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Step 2. Handle the API Response">
    After calling the API, the response will indicate the **final status** of the transaction. If the status is `cancelled`, the payment has been successfully cancelled.

    **Example Response:**

    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "id": "pay_ohXLNm2fPw6868",
        "status": "cancelled",
        "order_id": "ord_Dg0Dz9wwKP1602",
        "created_at": "2020-11-19T22:09:48Z",
        "updated_at": "2020-11-26T20:02:24.561169Z"
      }
    }
