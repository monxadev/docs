## Payment Flow

Monxa makes accepting payments across Asia simple and seamless by organizing the process into **order** and **charge**.

### Step 1: Create an Order

An **Order** represents the **customer‚Äôs intention to make a payment** before the actual transaction occurs. It acts as a placeholder or ‚Äúplan‚Äù for a payment, allowing the merchant to prepare and manage the transaction details ahead of time.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Key Points" icon="star" iconType="solid">
    - **Represents intent¬†**‚Üí An **order** is only the **_plan_** to pay, no money moves until a charge is created.
    - **Single source of truth** ‚Üí It tracks the entire lifecycle of a transaction (pending, succeeded, canceled, expired).
    - **Supports multiple attempts** ‚Üí Customers can retry failed payments with different methods under the same **order**.
    - **Expiry built-in** ‚Üí Each **order** has an expiry time to prevent indefinite open transactions.
    - **Locks in details** ‚Üí Amount and currency are fixed once the **order** is created, ensuring consistency.
    - **Connects to Charges** ‚Üí All payment **charges**¬†link back to the same **order**, giving clear traceability.
    - **Merchant control** ‚Üí Merchants can cancel **order** if an order is abandoned or invalid.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Important Notes" icon="triangle-exclamation" iconType="solid">
    When working with **Order**, keep these points in mind:

    - **Expiry Time** ‚Üí An **order** has a set lifetime. Once expired, no new charges can be created under it.
    - **One Final State** ‚Üí An**order**  can only end in **succeeded, canceled, or expired** state ‚Äî It cannot be reused once closed.
    - **Amount & Currency Lock** ‚Üí The amount and currency are fixed at creation and cannot be changed later.
    - **Multiple Charges** ‚Üí You can attempt multiple charges under the same **order**, but only one can succeed.
    - **Cancellation** ‚Üí Merchants may cancel an **order** manually if the customer abandons checkout or requests cancellation.
    - **Concurrency** ‚Üí Avoid creating multiple active **orders** for the same session to prevent double billing.
    - **Lifecycle Handling** ‚Üí Always track **order** status (via API or webhooks) to handle cases like failure, expiration, or cancellation.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  **Analogy:** Think of an **Order** as **placing items in a shopping cart**‚Äîit shows the intent to purchase, but no money has been transferred yet.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Create a Charge

A**Charge**  represents the **actual attempt to collect money** from the customer, based on an Order.  Each charge is tied to a payment method (e.g., credit card, bank transfer, e-wallet) and processes the transaction.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Key Points" icon="star" iconType="solid">
    - **Linked to an Order:** A **charge** can only exist within an active order.
    - **Execution of payment:** It‚Äôs the step where the system tries to move money from the customer to the merchant.
    - **Has its own expiry:** A **charge** attempt must be completed within its allowed time, and cannot exceed the order's expiry.
    - **Retry allowed:** If a **charge** fails, another charge can be created under the same order.
    - **Completion:** When a **charge** succeeds, the **order**  is marked as completed, and the transaction is finalized.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Important Notes" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    When working with **charges**, please keep the following in mind to avoid errors or duplicate payments:

    - **Charge Expiry** ‚Üí Each **charge** has its own expiry, but it cannot extend beyond the parent **order‚Äôs expiry**.
    - **Avoid Duplicates** ‚Üí Always check the **charge** status before retrying. Do not create multiple charges at the same time for the same intent.
    - **Failed Charges** ‚Üí A failed **charge** does **not** complete the order. Customers can retry with another method until the order expires.
    - **Pending Status** ‚Üí Some methods (e.g., bank transfers, QRIS, wallets) may return a **pending** status. Always use **webhooks** or polling to track updates.
    - **Idempotency** ‚Üí Use **idempotency keys** (if supported) to prevent accidental duplicate charges when resending API requests.
    - **Currency & Amount Lock** ‚Üí Once an order is created, its **amount and currency are fixed**; all charges must match.
    - **Declines & Fraud Checks** ‚Üí Be ready to handle declines from insufficient funds, fraud screening, or restrictions from payment providers.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  **Analogy:** Think of an **order as the plan, **and a**charge as the action**  of swiping the card or confirming the transfer.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Charge Processing

A **charge** represents the actual attempt to collect money. Once created, it will either succeed and finalize the transaction, or fail and allow the customer to retry.

- **When a charge succeeds:**
  - The **charge** status is updated to **completed**.
  - The linked **order** is also marked as **completed**, finalizing the transaction.
- **When a charge fails:**
  - The **order** stays active.
  - Customers can retry the payment **charge** with the same or a different method until the **order** expires.
