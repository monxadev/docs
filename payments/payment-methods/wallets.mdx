## Overview

An **e-wallet** (digital wallet) allows users to store value or link funding sources and authorize payments using the stored wallet or linked instruments. In many markets, e-wallets are a preferred method due to convenience, familiarity, and strong authentication.

By offering e-wallet payments via Monxa, merchants can:

- Provide a frictionless checkout experience
- Tap into local wallet popularity in Asia
- Leverage Monxa’s settlement, reconciliation, and refund capabilities in one unified system

## Integration Architecture

Below is a simplified architecture showing how Monxa, the merchant, and the wallet provider interact:

  M->>MX: POST /v1/charges (channel_code, amount, return_url, metadata)
  MX->>P: Create e-wallet payment request
  P-->>MX: Return approval UI / widget token
  MX-->>M: Return redirect / widget data
  M->>C: Redirect or render wallet UI
  C->>P: Authenticate & approve (PIN / OTP / in-app)
  P-->>MX: Webhook / callback with status (success / failure / pending)
  MX->>M: Webhook / callback to merchant with final status
  MX->>M: Later: settlement & reconciliation
```
