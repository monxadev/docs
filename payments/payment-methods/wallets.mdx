## Overview

A digital **Wallet** (e-wallet) allows users to store value or link funding sources and authorize payments using the stored wallet or linked instruments. In many markets, digital wallets are a preferred method due to convenience, familiarity, and strong authentication.

By offering digital wallet payments via Monxa, merchants can:

- Provide a frictionless checkout experience
- Tap into local wallet popularity in Asia
- Leverage Monxaâ€™s settlement, reconciliation, and refund capabilities in one unified system

## Payment Flow

Generally, wallet payments follow two types of flows: **redirection (jump app)** or **push notification**.

The diagram below illustrates a simplified architecture of how Monxa, the merchant, and the wallet provider interact.

### Step 1: Create a Charge

### Step 2: Redirect User to Wallet

After creating the payment request, use the response data to generate a QR code and present it to the user.

### Step 3: Customer Authorizes Payment

After creating the payment request, use the response data to generate a QR code and present it to the user.

### Step 4: Handle Webhooks & Update Payment Status

Monxa will send an asynchronous webhook to your configured endpoint:

**Handling Logic (Merchant Side)**

- On `SUCCESS`: mark order paid, fulfill goods
- On `FAILED` or `CANCELLED`: notify user, optionally prompt fallback
- On `PENDING`: you may poll or await final callback

<Tip>
  **Tip:** For general information on webhooks and best practices for handling them, refer to the [Webhook Guide ](/integration/webhooks)page.

## Refunds / Reversal

Refunds for e-wallet payments depend on the **capabilities of the wallet provider**.\
Some wallets support **full or partial refunds** through Monxaâ€™s API, while others **do not allow refunds** and require a manual refund process outside the system.

- **Supported wallets** â†’ You can request a **full or partial refund** via Monxaâ€™s `/v1/refunds` endpoint. The provider will process the reversal and return the funds to the customerâ€™s wallet balance.
- **Unsupported wallets** â†’ Refunds are **not available through the API**. Merchants must perform a **manual refund** (e.g., bank transfer, store credit, or direct arrangement with the customer).
- **Webhook notifications** â†’ For supported wallets, Monxa will notify you of refund status updates via events such as `refund.succeeded` or `refund.failed`.

<Warning>
  **Important**: Always check the walletâ€™s capabilities in Monxaâ€™s dashboard or API documentation. The refund feature may vary by provider and by country.
</Warning>

## Merchant Best Practices

- Place e-wallet options prominently in checkout, especially in regions where they are popular
- Use deep linking / SDK embed flows to minimize context switching
- Pre-validate wallet availability (region, currency, user status) before initiating the flow
- Handle `PENDING` status gracefully (polling, UI feedback)
- Log analytics around wallet provider, time to approve, dropoffs
- Provide alternative payment options if e-wallet fails
- If refund-to-wallet isnâ€™t supported, define clear fallback behavior (e.g. bank refund)
- Be cautious of transaction limits (some wallets limit per day / per transaction)
- Test across multiple devices, network conditions, and wallet states (e.g. insufficient balance)
