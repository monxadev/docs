title: "Check Payment Status"
description: "Actively verify payment status to keep your system synchronized, even when webhook updates are delayed."
---

The **Check Status mechanism** allows merchants to actively verify the latest status of a payment by querying the **Get Payment by ID API**.\
This ensures your system always reflects the most accurate transaction state, even if webhook updates are delayed or missed due to network issues, server downtime, or other technical factors.

## Why Implement Check Status?

While Monxa provides **real-time notifications via webhooks**, relying solely on them may introduce risks:

- **Webhook Delays** – Network or server issues can slow down updates.
- **Missed Events** – Downtime or connectivity issues may cause webhooks to fail.

By implementing Check Status, you have a **reliable fallback mechanism** to keep your system synchronized with the actual transaction status.

### How to Implement

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Step 1: Call the Get Payment by ID API" iconType="solid">
    Use the following endpoint to retrieve the latest status of a payment:

    | Method | Endpoint                                |
    | :----- | :-------------------------------------- |
    | GET    | `https://api.monxa.co/v1/payments/{id}` |

    Replace `{id}` with the `payment_id` you want to check.

    <Tip>
      **Tip:** For better accuracy, implement **interval-based polling** (e.g., retry with exponential backoff) until the transaction reaches a final state.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Step 2: Handle the API Response">
    The API response will include key transaction details.\
    Most importantly, the `status` parameter indicates the **current state** of the payment.\
    Your system should use this value to update the order or payment status accordingly.

    **Example Response:**

    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "id": "pay_123456789",
        "status": "completed",
        "order_id": "ord_987654321",
        "amount": 150000,
        "currency": "IDR",
        "created_at": "2025-09-10T10:15:30Z",
        "updated_at": "2025-09-10T10:17:05Z"
      }
    }
    ```
