description: "Stay synchronized with every stage of the payment lifecycle through real-time webhook events from Monxa."
---

Webhooks allow Monxa to **push real-time updates directly to your server** whenever there is a change in a transaction or order status.\
Instead of constantly polling our API, you simply provide a **callback URL**, and Monxa will automatically send an event notification to that endpoint whenever something important happens.

For example, if you configure your webhook to listen for `payment.completed`, your system will immediately receive a notification as soon as a payment is successfully processed. This enables you to update your records, trigger downstream workflows, or notify your customers—instantly and reliably.

## Payment Related Webhook Events

Here are the main events Monxa can send to your webhook URL, ensuring your system stays synchronized with every key payment lifecycle update:

| **Event Name**     | **When does it trigger?**                                                                                                                                        |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `intent.created`   | Triggered when a payment is successfully created.                                                                                                                |
| `intent.completed` | Triggered when a payment has been fully paid. This means one or more charges have been completed and the total amount has been captured.                         |
| `charge.completed` | Triggered when a charge is successfully processed and confirmed by Monxa. You can safely use this event to mark the related transaction or payment as completed. |
| `charge.failed`    | Triggered when a charge attempt fails due to a timeout or other processing error.                                                                                |
| `charge.cancelled` | Triggered when a charge is cancelled by the customer before it is completed.                                                                                     |
| `charge.expired`   | Triggered when a charge request expires before completion.                                                                                                       |
